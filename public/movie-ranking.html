<h2>My favorite movies</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>The Last Unicorn</h3>
<p>Sure it's popular now, but I'm an OG fan. The story is wonderful and the soundtrack by America is still exceptional.</p>

<h3>Secret of NIMH</h3>
<p>The best film Don Bluth Studios produced.  Startlingly beautiful animation, a nice soundtrack, and the climax is a robot test.</p>

<h3>Flight of Dragons</h3>
<p>Incredibly detaild artwork when you remember this was all done by hand.  Looks like an animated baroque tapestry, and the story is pretty good too.</p>
