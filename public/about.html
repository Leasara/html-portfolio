<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Raised in the American South West, Leasara is a wanderer at home wherever she goes.
  Her passions include wildneress conservation, urban renewal eschewing gentrification, and teaching others to be as happy as she is.

 <p>
  These days Lea is learning to build websites with the goal of starting a few new sites.
  One will be a home for her husband's webcomic.
  Another will aim to help people learn to cook dishes that avoid their food sensativites.
  She's got three others she's considering, but doesn't want to discuss yet.
 </p>

 <p>
  Her hobbies include cycling, camping, photography, gaming, and she hopes to add kayak fishing to the list soon.
